This repository contains the code and assets for the Base Learn Badges.

>this is just for a tutorial to get Base testnet badge on Guild.xyz . and not handling real funds, the original code is fine for learning purposes. <b>I don't recommend to deploy it on mainnet. I will make a tutorial for deploying a contract on mainnet separately</b>

<b>I don't know if it will be rewarded in mainnet or not.</b>
