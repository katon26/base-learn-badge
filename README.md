Base Learn Badge

The Base community is exploding in popularity, and Discord roles are the ultimate symbol of your journey. Just like leveling up in a game, you can earn badges that showcase your growing expertise.

From Newcomer to Supreme badge, this repo maps out the five roles you’ll gett. 
Each step is a chance to learn, experiment, and show off your Base expertise. I hope this repo clearly illustrates how to get each badge, as im currently still learning how to write this guide and not of this code is mine at all, all credit goes to the original author.

No prior experience? No problem—start small and work your way up!

# Disclaimer
>this is just for a tutorial to get Base testnet badge on Guild.xyz . and not handling real funds, the original code is fine for learning purposes. <b>I don't recommend to deploy it on mainnet. I will make a tutorial for deploying a contract on mainnet separately</b>

<b>I don't know if it will be rewarded in mainnet or not.</b>
